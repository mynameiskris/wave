\title{Estimate VE using method from Tian et al. 2005}
\usage{
tian_ve(dat, n_days, n_periods, n_days_period, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{data set}

\item{n_days}{number of days in the study}

\item{n_periods}{number of periods in the study}

\item{n_days_period}{number of days per period}

\item{alpha}{hypothesis critical value}
}
\value{
number of times the null hypothesis is rejected
}
\description{
In this method, kernel-weighted partial likelihood approach is used to estimate the time-dependent coefficient
in the generalized Cox model [REF] .  At each time point, the estimate is obtained by maximizing a smooth
concave function of a p x 1 vector of parameters, where p is the dimension of the vector of covariates. To test the hypothesis of no VE waning
(i.e., the proportional hazards assumption is met), confidence bands from the distribution of the estimated
cumulative function of beta(t) can be obtained. If the line (0,0) is not contained within the confidence band
s over the entire time interval, then the proportional hazards assumption is not met and the null hypothesis
of no VE waning is rejected.
